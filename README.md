# lending-library
This was the first Kotlin project that I've attempted.

Implements a lending library where an owner can add books, it is assumed that there is only one copy of each book
Ananonymous users are able to search the library by title, author or ISBN. 

I have assumed that ISBN is unique and the owner cannot enter two books with the same ISBN

The owner can get a count of the number of books that are borrowed.
